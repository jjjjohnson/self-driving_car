1. tl_detector node is not publishing the correct tl stop line index.
   As a hack, in the waypoint_updater.py, we are trying to stop
   20 waypoints before the tl stop_line index published by traffic_waypoint
   topic. This hack needs to be removed and fix needs to be done in tl_detector
   node.

2. Currently car is not stoping at first red traffic signal.
   This needs to be fixed.

3. Optimization step: Currently inference is happening on all the images.
   This needs to be modified to perform inference only in the vicinity
   of the traffic light.

4. publish() call in the waypoint_updater.py is being called from traffic_cb.
   Need to check if this call has to be moved to pose_cb.

5. How to upload the huge model file? Need to check with Udacity.
